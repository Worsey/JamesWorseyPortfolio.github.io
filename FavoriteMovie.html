			<h2 id="p1">Why?</h2>
			<h3 id="p2">I don't really have a favorite movie, but this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. 
			This film had some of the bes humor that I have seen in a film.
			When I went into see the film it wasn't exactly what I expected, but it suprised me and was a great film.</h3>
		</p>
			<h2 id="p1"> Favorite Actor </h2>
			<h3 id="p2"> My favorite actor in the film was Keegan Michael Key.
			He did a great job, along with all of the other actors in the film, of getting into character whenever he was on stage.
			He also did a great job of switching between characters and made his character seem very convincing.
