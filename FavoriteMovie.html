	<h2 id="p1">Why?</h2>
	<h3>I don't really have a favorite movie, but this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. 
	The film was a great western heist thriller and was very enjoyable to watch. 
	The film was very well paced and had a good balance between it funny moments and its serious moments, its action moments and slow moments. 
	The film also wasn't very predictable, you would think one thing was going to happen, but it wouldn't or would just in a different way.</h3>

	<h2 id="p2"> Favorite Actor </h2>
	<h3> My favorite actor in the film was Ben Foster. 
	He did a great job of acting the role of a brother who has been in and out of prison and is trying to help his brother who needs money and to take money from the banks that are making their life hard ever since their mother died.
	His character was slightly crazy and he did a great job of showing that characteristic.
	Also when there were the serious/sincere moments he did a great job of changing from being a slightly crazy brother.
