			<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
			<p>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>Created my name in a scratch project. I had to have it do three different actions. When the green flag was clicked it had to run and I added  a way of resetting it when the space key was pressed.</h3>
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Leardned</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>
				<li>Event blocks - when green flag clicked.</li>
				<li>Motion blocks - making the sprite move along the x and y axis, I also made them rotate and change size.</li>
				<li>Loops - making the sprite repeat an action for a set amount of time or forever.</li>
				<li>Sprites - used the library to find sprites that were the letters of my name.</li>
				</h3>
			</ul>

			<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
			<p>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>Created a presentation in scratch that presented 4 different options for buying a computer. The computer was for and animation student who need a laptop under $1600. We ended up choosing a Dell, Razor, Lenovo and Mac as the options.</h3>
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Leardned</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>
				<li>Conditional statements -  when a sprite was touching another sprite it would display information about the computer.</li>
				<li>Changing backgrounds - The background would change when a preset button was pressed.</li>
				<li>Sprites - created sprites and programmed one of them to move when the WASD keys were pressed.</li>
				</h3>

			<!-- Final Project -->
			<h1>Final Project</h1>
			<p>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>I had to create a game for my final project in scratch. The game was a survival game set in the woods. There were different items required for you to survive, that you would have to gather, and there were also wild animals that you would have to fight off. Once you survived seven day you would win.</h3>
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Leardned</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>
				<li>Variables - I created variables that represented different items. They would decrease in value as time went on or increase if you gathered the materials.</li>
				<li>Creating Blocks - I created blocks that were actions that happened more than once.</li>
				<li>Broadcasting - I used broadcasts so sprites could communicate with one another. </li>
				</h3>
			</ul>
